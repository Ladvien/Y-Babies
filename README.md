Ladvien is in process of re-creating the design into several versions meant to meet multiple needs.  This will result in
several versions that range the spectrum of high-function and diminutiveness. Also, these designs will attempt to include
both PicAxe and ATtiny users and attempt to include both those comfortable with SMD and through-hole PCB assembly.

The primary functions sought:

  1. Movement.
  2. Limited steering.
  3. Ability to communicate one-to-one.
  
Optional functions:
  
  1. Rechargeable coin-cell battery.
  2. A charging circuit.
  3. Distance sensor(s).
  4. Sharp steering.
  5. Ability to communicate one-to-many.

This repo contains the works, both tested and untested.  Therefore, folders will be marked "Untested" until someone confirms the build works.

Again, the purpose is to create a diminutive robot given the following constraints: Small size, total expense, functions, and individualized purposes.
